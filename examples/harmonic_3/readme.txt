Runs a simple hot beam of 50 particles in theta and 20 in p. There is an inital field of
near zero and shot noise in both theta and p. The thrid harmonic is modelled and amplified
via theta phase sifting. The first and third harmonics are the only modelled.
Run in a terminal using:

 $ boffin input_file.bffn -sa -shift -h 2 -hp 2 -ap

This will run Boffin using the input file and display a plot of the radiation
field evolution.
